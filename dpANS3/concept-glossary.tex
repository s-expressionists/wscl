% !!! Moon wonders if "denote" is the right verb for talking about what "designators"
%     refer to.
%
% !!! Moon thinks the bottom header gets too close to the running text in this chapter.
%     It even overstrikes on a few pages (e.g., p26-28 of draft 10.156)
%
% Barmar thinks we should define reference terms for expressions like "left & right".
%
% Moon sez: Most occurrences of "which" in the glossary should be "that" in correct English.
% I should review this later. -kmp
%
% Think about unifying terms: "type lattice", "type hierarchy", "type hierarchy lattice",
% "directed acyclic graph".
% RPG says "hierarchy" or "dag" are ok, but not "lattice".
% Allan Wechsler (ACW@Symbolics.COM) says: 
%  Regarding DAGs vs. lattices: I don't know the basis of Dick Gabriel's
%  objection to the latter term.  I think that it's quite clear
%  mathematically that "lattice" is correct and "directed acyclic graph" is
%  incorrect, but Gabriel's objection may not be mathematical.  Details on
%  request.  I'm using the definitions from the ``Encyclopedic Dictionary of
%  Mathematics.''
%
% Think about these terms, which are commonly used without definition:
%   "qualifier pattern" - something that gets matched against in method comb.
%   "type specifier list" - the list form of a type specifier
%   "default value"
%   "optional parameter", ...
%
% Think about these terms, which are common concepts in search of a name, to cut
% down on wasted verbiage at multiple places in the text.
%   "stringname" - a string or a symbol, which is taken the name of a string.
%                  if a symbol, then then it is treated as if its name had been supplied.
%
% Sometime search for braces immediately followed by an alpha char 
% ("{...}s", "{...}es", "{...}ing", "{...}ed", etc.) because these are often
% clues to needed glossary words.
%
% KMP: Maybe a term "user symbol" being defined as 
%      "a symbol that is not accessible in the common-lisp package".
%    (I find it cumbersome to write a param description that says
%     a symbol that is not in the common-lisp package.
%    This comes up in a number of places.)
% Barmar: That sounds like a reasonable term and definition.
% KMP: Issue--some places might need a restriction on keywords, too, but that should
%    probably not be piggy-backed on the "user symbol" term.

%% Glossary
 
Each entry in this glossary has the following parts:
 
\beginlist
 
\item{\bull} the term being defined, set in boldface.
 
 \item{\bull} optional pronunciation, enclosed in square brackets and
set in boldface, as in the following example:
\pronounced{\Stress{a}\stress{list}}.  The pronunciation key follows
\WebstersDictionary\TypographyCaveats.
 
 \item{\bull} the part or parts of speech, set in italics.  If a term
can be used as several parts of speech, there is a separate definition
for each part of speech.
 
 \item{\bull} one or more definitions, organized as follows:
 
\beginlist
 
 \item{--} an optional number, present if there are several
definitions. Lowercase letters might also be used in cases where subdefinitions of
a numbered definition are necessary.
 
 \item{--} an optional part of speech, set in italics, present if the
term is one of several parts of speech.
 
 \item{--} an optional discipline, set in italics, present if the term
has a standard definition being repeated. For example, ``{\Mathematics}''
 
 \item{--} an optional context, present if this definition is
meaningful only in that context. For example, ``(of a \term{symbol})''.
 
 \item{--} the definition.
 
 \item{--} an optional example sentence. For example,
           \gexample{This is an example of an example.}
 
 \item{--} optional cross references.
%%There are a lot of options, and they are all pretty self-explanatory. -kmp 11-Sep-91
%A cross reference to another word uses the following form: \Seeterm{word}.
%A cross reference to a section uses the following form: \Seesection\Sample.
 
\endlist
\endlist
 
In addition, some terms have idiomatic usage in the Common Lisp
community which is not shared by other communities, or which is not
technically correct.  Definitions labeled ``{\Idiomatic}'' represent
such idiomatic usage; these definitions are sometimes followed by an
explanatory note.
 
Words in \term{this font} are words with entries in the glossary.
%Word in \typeref{this font} are names of data types.
Words in example sentences do not follow this convention.
 
When an ambiguity arises, the longest matching substring has precedence.
For example, ``\term{complex float}'' refers to a single glossary entry 
for ``\term{complex float}'' rather than the combined meaning of the 
glossary terms ``\term{complex}'' and ``\term{float}.''

Subscript notation, as in ``\term{something}\meaning{n}'' means that
the \i{n}th definition of ``\term{something}'' is intended.  This
notation is used only in situations where the context might be insufficient
to disambiguate.

  that \term{establishes} the \term{variable} or \term{function},
  but before the body of that \term{special form}
% This next parenthetical remark was added because Moon thinks (and I agree)
% that rather than just "within" we need to say "at the head of the body" 
% in order to make it clear that 
%    (let ((a (let ((b 1))
%               (declare (fixnum a))
%               (expt b 100))))

%    is not accidentally covered.
  (specifically, at the head of that \term{form}'s body).
%!!! Barmar: The following should be replaced by a cross-reference to a
%   	     concept section.
  (If a \term{bound declaration} refers to a \term{function} \term{binding} or
   a \term{lexical variable} \term{binding}, the \term{scope} of
   the \term{declaration} is exactly the \term{scope} of that

\gentry{em} \Noun\ \Traditional\ 
  a context-dependent unit of measure commonly used in typesetting,
  equal to the displayed width of of a letter ``M'' in the current font.
  (The letter ``M'' is traditionally chosen because it is typically 
   represented by the widest \term{glyph} in the font, and other characters' 
   widths are typically fractions of an \term{em}.  In implementations providing 
   non-Roman characters with wider characters than ``M,'' it is permissible 
   for another character to be the \term{implementation-defined} reference character
   for this measure, and for ``M'' to be only a fraction of an \term{em}
   wide.)  
  In a fixed width font, a line with \i{n} characters is \i{n} 
  \term{ems} wide; in a variable width font, \i{n} \term{ems} is the
  expected upper bound on the width of such a line.

% KMP->Barmar:
%  You remarked that you think you can rely on array-element-type and 
%  upgraded-xxx-type. This is intended to permit a compiler optimizer like:
%      (frob (make-array n :element-type '(unsigned-byte 13)))
%  to turn into
%      (si:frob-internal-signed-byte-13 
%        (make-array n :element-type '(unsigned-byte 13)))
%  even though the implementation knows that (unsigned-byte 16) will really get
%  allocated, let's say.  Moreover, the compiler should be permitted to warn about:
%      (defun foo (n) 
%        (let ((x (make-array n :element-type '(unsigned-byte 2))))
% 	 (setf (aref x 0) 17.) ...))
%  It generally will not warn about:
%      (defun foo (n)
%        (bar (make-array n :element-type '(unsigned-byte 2))))
%      (defun bar (a)
%        (setf (aref x 0) 17.) ...)
%  I agree that it should never warn about:
%      (defun foo (n) 
%        (let ((x (make-array n :element-type '(unsigned-byte 2))))
% 	 (when (type-equivalent-p (array-element-type x) 'fixnum)
% 	    (setf (aref x 0) 17.) ...)))
%  because this is portably guarded even if it behaves differently on the
%  different implementations to which it is ported.
% 
%  This makes it tough to do the optimization I'm referring to, but I don't
%  think that implementations which really properly check that the path is
%  clear between the allocation and the reference should be forbidden from
%  flagging an unconditional non-portability.
%
% Barmar: 
%  You apparently understand the point I was making.  If you can come up
%  with a concise way to phrase it in the definition of "declared XXX
%  type", that's all I was hoping for.  If not, I don't think this is a
%  critical issue.

  Neither a use of a \term{symbol} as a \term{function designator} nor a

\gentry{Lisp image} \Noun\
  a running instantiation of a \clisp\ \term{implementation}.
  A \term{Lisp image} is characterized by a single address space in which any
  \term{object} can directly refer to any another in conformance with this specification,
  and by a single, common, \term{global environment}.
  (External operating systems sometimes call this a 
       ``core image,''
       ``fork,''
       ``incarnation,'' 
       ``job,''
    or ``process.''  Note however, that the issue of a ``process'' in such 
    an operating system is technically orthogonal to the issue of a \term{Lisp image}
    being defined here.  Depending on the operating system, a single ``process'' 
    might have multiple \term{Lisp images}, and multiple ``processes'' might reside
    in a single \term{Lisp image}.  Hence, it is the idea of a fully shared address
    space for direct reference among all \term{objects} which is the defining
    characteristic.  Note, too, that two ``processes'' which have a communication 
    area that permits the sharing of some but not all \term{objects} are considered
    to be distinct \term{Lisp images}.)

  an endless loop that \term{reads}\meaning{2} a \term{form},
  \term{evaluates} it,
  and prints (\ie \term{writes}\meaning{2}) the results.
  In many \term{implementations},
  the default mode of interaction with \clisp\ during program development
  is through such a loop.

\gentry{Lisp reader} \Noun\ \Traditional\

\gentry{list structure} \Noun\ (of a \term{list})
  the set of \term{conses} that make up the \term{list}.
  Note that while the \term{car}\meaning{1b} component of each such \term{cons}
  is part of the \term{list structure}, 
  the \term{objects} that are \term{elements} of the \term{list}
  (\ie the \term{objects} that are the \term{cars}\meaning{2} of each \term{cons}
   in the \term{list})
  are not themselves part of its \term{list structure}, 
  even if they are \term{conses},
  except in the (\term{circular}\meaning{2})
  case where the \term{list} 
  actually contains one of its \term{tails} as an \term{element}.
  (The \term{list structure} of a \term{list} is sometimes redundantly 
   referred to as its ``top-level list structure'' in order to emphasize
   that any \term{conses} that are \term{elements} of the \term{list} 
   are not involved.)

\gentry{purports to conform} \Verb\
  makes a good-faith claim of conformance.  
  This term expresses intention to conform, regardless of whether the
  goal of that intention is realized in practice.  
  For example, language implementations have been known to have bugs,
  and while an \term{implementation} of this specification with bugs
  might not be a \term{conforming implementation}, it can still
  \term{purport to conform}.  This is an important distinction in
  certain specific cases; \eg \seevar{*features*}.
