Problem Description:

  The description of CASE/ECASE/CCASE talks about keys "matching" a clause, but this
  term is not define either in the description or in the glossary.

Proposal (MATCHING-IN-CASE:EQL):

 Replace "match", "matches", "matching" by "are the same as", etc.

Test case:

Rationale:

Current practice:

  All existing implementations understand matching as being the same in the
  sense of EQL.

Cost to Implementors:

  None.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of Non-Adoption:

  Unclear spec.

Discussion:

  None as yet.
