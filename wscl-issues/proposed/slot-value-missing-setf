Issue:        SLOT-VALUE-MISSING-SETF
Forum:        Cleanup
Category:     CHANGE
Status:       proposed

Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the description of
  SLOT-VALUE gives no indication that implementations must support

    (setf (slot-value INSTANCE SLOT-NAME) NEW-VALUE)

  .

Proposal (SLOT-VALUE-MISSING-SETF:ADD):

  1. Change the ftype of the SLOT-VALUE component from "Function" to
     "Accessor"

  2. In the "Syntax" compartment of the SLOT-VALUE component, add the
     line

       \Defsetf {slot-value} {object slot-name} {new-value}

  3. In the "Arguments and values" compartment of the SLOT-VALUE
     component, add

       \param{new-value}---an \term{object}.

Current Practice:

  It is almost certain that all existing implementations conform to
  this proposal. Users rely on the described functionality.

Cost to Implementors:

  None.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  Either an incomplete specification, if the absence of the proposed
  changes is considered an accidental omission, or much less useful
  instance slots, if the absense of the proposed changes is considered
  deliberate.

Benefits:

  Either a more complete specification or more useful instance slots.

Aesthetics:

  This change makes SLOT-VALUE consistent other accessors for
  slot-like places such as AREF. The inconsistency likely stems from
  an accidental omission.

Discussion:

  None so far.
