Problem Description:

  The Exceptional Situations section for WITH-HASH-TABLE-ITERATOR claims it
  establishes a local function, and refers to it being called. Should be a
  local macro.

Proposal (WITH-HASH-TABLE-ITERATOR-BINDING-TYPE:CLARIFY-MACRO):

  Delete the Exceptional Situations section, since it's not actually describing
  signaling behavior. Add a line in the Description section saying something
  like "The consequences are undefined if an invocation (name) takes place
  after a previous invocation has returned false as its primary value."

Rationale:

  The rest of the page is quite clear that the name is bound to a macro,
  including a specific mention of using MACROLET to bind it.

Current practice:

  No known implementation binds the name as a function instead of a macro.

Cost to Implementors:

  None.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Benefits:

  Clarity.

Aesthetics:

Discussion:

  Bruno Haible says: I agree, should be local macro. But since macros cannot be
  called, it needs reformulation.

  Bike says: I reformulated it in terms of the "invocation" phrase used within
  the Description section.
