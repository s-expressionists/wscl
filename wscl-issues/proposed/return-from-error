Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the description of the
  special operator RETURN-FROM indicates no exceptional situations.

Proposal (RETURN-FROM-ERROR:SIGNAL-ERROR-IN-SAFE-CODE):

  This proposal changes the description of the RETURN-FROM special
  operator, so that the section "Exceptional Situations" contains the
  following text:

  "The special operator RETURN-FROM will signal an error of type
  PROGRAM-ERROR if no BLOCK form named NAME lexically encloses the
  occurrence of the RETURN-FROM form."

Test Cases:

  (defmacro one (block-name return-name)
    `(locally
       (declare (optimize (safety 3)))
       (block ,block-name
         (return-from ,return-name))))

  (one a a) => NIL
  (one a b) => [signals PROGRAM-ERROR]

Rationale:

  We think it was a simple omission from the draft ANSI specification
  to indicate no exceptional situations.

Current Practice:

  ABCL 1.8.1-dev-fasl43
    (one a a) => NIL
    (one a b) => [signals ERROR]

  ACL 10.1
    (one a a) => NIL
    (one a b) => [signals CONTROL-ERROR]

  CCL 1.12-f98
    (one a a) => NIL
    (one a b) => [signals PROGRAM-ERROR]

  CLASP cclasp-boehmprecise-0.4.2-4619-g23bf6aa3d-cst
    (one a a) => NIL
    (one a b) => [signals PROGRAM-ERROR]

  CLISP 2.49.93+
    (one a a) => NIL
    (one a b) => [signals SIMPLE-ERROR]

  CMU 2019-05-27 16:42:54 (21D Unicode)
    (one a a) => NIL
    (one a b) => [signals PROGRAM-ERROR]

  ECL 21.2.1-e68e6827
    (one a a) => NIL
    (one a b) => [signals SIMPLE-ERROR]

  LWPE 7.1.2
    (one a a) => NIL
    (one a b) => [signals PROGRAM-ERROR]

  SBCL 2.1.7
    (one a a) => NIL
    (one a b) => [signals PROGRAM-ERROR]

Cost to Implementors:

  Very small.  Most implementations already signal an error and
  would only need to change the implementation of RETURN-FROM to
  signal the correct error.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  Application programmers may need to add explicit checks to be
  certain that their code is conforming.

Benefits:

  Application programmers may rely on an error being
  signaled in safe code, and thus avoid having to
  add explicit checks in portable code.

Aesthetics:

  No influence.

Discussion:

  TODO
