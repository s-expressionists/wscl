References:     VALUES

Problem Description:

  (values &allow-other-keys) matches the syntax for the VALUES type specifier,
  but the description doesn't say what it means.

Proposal (VALUES-&ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS:DISALLOW):

  Don't mention &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS as being allowed in the VALUES type specifier.

Test case:

  ;;; This is allowed by the standard, going off of the syntax section, but
  ;;; the meaning is not clear.
  (the (values integer &allow-other-keys) 5)

Rationale:

  Because the syntax does not allow &KEY, &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS was probably a
  mistake.

Current practice:

    (the (values integer &allow-other-keys) 5) => 5

  ACL 10.1
    (the (values integer &allow-other-keys) 5) => [signals simple-error]
