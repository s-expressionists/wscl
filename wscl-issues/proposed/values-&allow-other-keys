Problem Description:

  (values &allow-other-keys) matches the syntax for the VALUES type specifier,
  but the description doesn't say what it means.

Proposal (VALUES-&ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS:DISALLOW):

  Don't mention &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS as being allowed in the VALUES type specifier.

Test case:

  ;;; This is allowed by the standard, going off of the syntax section, but
  ;;; the meaning is not clear.
  (the (values integer &allow-other-keys) 5)

Rationale:

  Because the syntax does not allow &KEY, &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS was probably a
  mistake.

Current practice:

  ABCL 1.8.1-dev-fasl43
    (the (values integer &allow-other-keys) 5) => 5

  CLISP 2.49.93+
    (the (values integer &allow-other-keys) 5) => 5

  CLASP cclasp-boehmprecise-0.4.2-4453-gee36ba131-cst
    (the (values integer &allow-other-keys) 5) => 5

  CMU 2019-05-27 16:42:54 (21D Unicode)
    (the (values integer &allow-other-keys) 5) => [signals program-error]

  ECL 21.2.1-e68e6827
    (the (values integer &allow-other-keys) 5) => 5

  SBCL 2.1.7
    (the (values integer &allow-other-keys) 5) => [signals program-error]

Cost to Implementors:

  None.

Cost to Users:

Cost of Non-Adoption:
