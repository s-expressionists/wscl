Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the description of the type
  BOOLEAN [a] can be more accurate.

    [a]: The type boolean contains the symbols t and nil, [..]

  It is more accurate to use the word "consists of" than "contains". After
  all, according to the glossary [b], BOOLEAN is exclusively either the symbol
  T or the symbol NIL.

    [b]: boolean n. an object of type boolean; that is, one of the following
    objects: the symbol t (representing true), or the symbol nil (representing
    false).

Proposal: (BOOLEAN-DEFINITION:TYPE-BOOLEAN-IS-T-OR-NIL)

  This proposal changes the description of the type BOOLEAN so that [a]
  instead reads:

    > The type boolean consists of the symbols t and nil, [..]

Test Cases:

  N/A (Test cases are difficult to provide, because conforming implementations
  are not expected to expose their definitions of the type BOOLEAN
  programmatically.)

Rationale:

  This is an improvement for clarity in dpANS.

Current Practice:

  SBCL 2.4.1
    (slot-value (sb-kernel::specifier-type 'boolean) 'sb-kernel::xset)
      ;; => #S(SB-INT:XSET :DATA (NIL T) :EXTRA 2)

Cost to Implementors:

  None.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  None.

Benefits:

  It makes the standard more accurate.

Aesthetics:

  No influence.

Discussion:

  None.
