Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the description of the type
  BOOLEAN [a] can be more accurate.

    [a]: The type boolean contains the symbols t and nil, [..]

  It is more accurate to use the word "consists of" than "contains". After
  all, according to the glossary [b], BOOLEAN is exclusively either the symbol
  T or the symbol NIL.

    [b]: boolean n. an object of type boolean; that is, one of the following
    objects: the symbol t (representing true), or the symbol nil (representing
    false).

Proposal: (BOOLEAN-DEFINITION:TYPE-BOOLEAN-IS-T-OR-NIL)

  This proposal changes the description of the type BOOLEAN so that [a]
  instead reads:

    > The type boolean consists of the symbols t and nil, [..]

Test Cases:

(defun one ()
    (assert
     (and
      (equal '(t t)
             (multiple-value-list (subtypep 'boolean '(member t nil))))
      (equal '(t t)
             (multiple-value-list (subtypep '(member t nil) 'boolean))))))

  (one) ; => NIL

Rationale:

  This is an improvement for clarity in dpANS.

Current Practice:

  SBCL 2.4.1
    (one) ; => NIL

  ECL 23.9.9
    (one) ; => NIL

Cost to Implementors:

  None.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  None.

Benefits:

  It makes the standard more accurate.

Aesthetics:

  No influence.

Discussion:
