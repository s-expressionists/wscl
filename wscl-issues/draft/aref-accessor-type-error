Issue:          AREF-ACCESSOR-TYPE-ERROR
Forum:          Cleanup
Category:       CLARIFICATION
Status:         draft

Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the description of
  the accessor AREF indicates no exceptional situations.  The section
  "Arguments and Values" mentions that the array argument must be
  an array, which by default means that the consequences are undefined
  if an object that is not of type array is given.

Proposal (AREF-ACCESSOR-TYPE-ERROR:SIGNAL-ERROR-IN-SAFE-CODE):

  This proposal changes the description of the AREF accessor, so that
  the section "Exceptional Situations" instead reads:

  "The accessor AREF should signal an error of type TYPE-ERROR
  if given an argument which is not an array.

Test Cases:

  (defun one (object)
    (declare (optimize (safety 3)))
    (aref object 0))

  (one 234) => ERROR: The value 234 is not of type ARRAY.

  (defun two (object)
    (declare (optimize (safety 3)))
    (setf (aref object 0) 345))

  (two 234) => ERROR: The value 234 is not of type ARRAY.

Rationale:

  We think it was a simple omission from the draft ANSI specification
  to indicate no exceptional situations.

Current Practice:

  SBCL 2.1.3
    (one)   => ERROR: The value 234 is not of type ARRAY.
    (two)   => ERROR: The value 234 is not of type ARRAY.
