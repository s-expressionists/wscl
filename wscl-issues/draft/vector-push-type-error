Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the description of the
  functions VECTOR-PUSH and VECTOR-PUSH-EXTEND indicates no exceptional
  situations for when the NEW-ELEMENT is not of a type indicated by the
  ELEMENT-TYPE of the VECTOR.

Proposal (VECTOR-PUSH-TYPE-ERROR:SIGNAL-ERROR-IN-SAFE-CODE):

  This proposal changes the description of the VECTOR-PUSH function, so that
  the section "Exceptional Situations" instead reads:

  "The functions VECTOR-PUSH and VECTOR-PUSH-EXTEND should signal an error of
  type TYPE-ERROR if given a NEW-ELEMENT not of a type indicated by the
  ELEMENT-TYPE of the VECTOR.

Test Cases:

  (defun one ()
    (declare (optimize (safety 3)))
    (vector-push 0 (make-array 5 :fill-pointer 2
                                 :element-type 'character
                                 :initial-element #\a)))

  (one) => ERROR: The value 5 is not of type CHARACTER.

Rationale:

  We think it was a simple omission from the draft ANSI specification to
  indicate no exceptional situations.

Current Practice:

  SBCL 2.4.1
    (one) => [signals type-error]

  ECL 23.9.9
    (one) => [signals simple-type-error]

Cost to Implementors:

  Very small. We believe that most implementations are already signaling an
  error in safe code. Some implementations may signal a simple error, and
  those implementation would need to signal a type-error instead.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  Application programmers may need to add numerous explicit checks to be
  certain that their code is conforming.

Benefits:

  Application programmers may rely on an error being signaled in safe code,
  and thus avoid having to add explicit checks in portable code.

Aesthetics:

  No influence.

Discussion:

  N/A.
