Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the Exceptional
  Situations section in the description of the function
  PPRINT-INDENT, the function PPRINT-NEWLINE, and the function
  PPRINT-TAB are not consistent in regards to the errors signaled
  for invalid KIND or RELATIVE-TO arguments. The text for each
  function is listed below.

  1. PPRINT-INDENT: "An error is signaled if relative-to is any
     object other than :block or :current."

  2. PPRINT-NEWLINE: "An error of type type-error is signaled if
     kind is not one of :linear, :fill, :miser, or :mandatory."

  3. PPRINT-TAB: "An error is signaled if kind is not one of
     :line, :section, :line-relative, or :section-relative."

Proposal (PPRINT-INVALID-KIND-OR-RELATIVE-TO:SIGNAL-ERROR-IN-SAFE-CODE):

  This proposal changes the description of the PPRINT-INDENT and
  the PPRINT-TAB functions to specify that a TYPE-ERROR will be
  signaled in these situations. The individual proposed changes
  to the descriptions are:

  1. Change the text of section "Exceptional Situations" of the
     PPRINT-INDECT function to read: "An error of type type-error
     is signaled if relative-to is any object other than :block
     or :current."

  2. Change the text of section "Exceptional Situations" of the
     PPRINT-TAB function to read: "An error of type type-error
     is signaled if kind is not one of :line, :section,
     :line-relative, or :section-relative."

Test Cases:

  (defun one (object)
    (declare (optimize (safety 3)))
    (pprint-indent object 0))

  (defun two (object)
    (declare (optimize (safety 3)))
    (pprint-newline object))

  (defun three (object)
    (declare (optimize (safety 3)))
    (pprint-tab object 10 10))

  (one :bar) => [signals TYPE-ERROR with expected type
                  (MEMBER :BLOCK :CURRENT)]
  (two :bar) => [signals TYPE-ERROR with expected type
                  (MEMBER :LINEAR :MISER :FILL :MANDATORY)]
  (three :bar) => [signals TYPE-ERROR with expected type
                    (MEMBER :LINE :SECTION :LINE-RELATIVE
                            :SECTION-RELATIVE)]

Rationale:

  We think it was a small error in the draft ANSI specification
  to not specify that the functions PPRINT-INDENT and PPRINT-TAB
  signaled a TYPE-ERROR for invalid KIND or RELATIVE-TO
  arguments.

Cost to Implementors:

  Very small.  Only ABCL and CCL are currently non-conformant.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  Application programmers may need to add explicit checks to be
  certain that their code is conforming.

Benefits:

  Consistent behavior across all implementations.

Aesthetics:

  No influence.

Discussion:

  TODO
