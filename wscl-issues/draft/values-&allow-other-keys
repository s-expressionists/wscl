References:     VALUES

Problem Description:

  (values &allow-other-keys) matches the syntax for the VALUES type specifier,
  but the description doesn't say what it means.

Proposal (VALUES-&ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS:DISALLOW):

  Don't mention &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS as being allowed in the VALUES type specifier.

Test case:

  ;;; This is allowed by the standard, going off of the syntax section, but
  ;;; the meaning is not clear.
  (the (values integer &allow-other-keys) 5) ; => [signals PROGRAM-ERROR]

Rationale:

  Because the syntax does not allow &KEY, &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS was probably a
  mistake.

Current practice:

Cost to Implementors:

  None.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of Non-Adoption:

  Unclear spec.

Discussion:

  Bruno Haible supports proposal DISALLOW.
