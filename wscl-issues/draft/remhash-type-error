Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the description of the
  function REMHASH indicates no exceptional situations.  The section
  "Arguments and Values" mentions that the hash-table argument must be
  a hash table, which by default means that the consequences are
  undefined if an object that is not of type HASH-TABLE is given.

Proposal (REMHASH-TYPE-ERROR:SIGNAL-ERROR-IN-SAFE-CODE):

  This proposal changes the description of the REMHASH function, so
  that the section "Exceptional Situations" instead reads:

  "The function REMHASH should signal an error of type TYPE-ERROR if
  the hash-table argument is not a hash table."

Test Cases:

  (defun one (object)
    (declare (optimize (safety 3)))
    (remhash 345 object))

  (one 234) ; => [signals TYPE-ERROR with expected type HASH-TABLE]

Rationale:

  We think it was a simple omission from the draft ANSI specification
  to indicate no exceptional situations.

Current Practice:

Cost to Implementors:

  Very small.  We believe that most implementations are already
  signaling an error in safe code.  Some implementations may signal a
  simple error, and those implementation would need to signal a
  type-error instead.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  Application programmers may need to add explicit checks to be
  certain that their code is conforming.

Benefits:

  Application programmers may rely on an error being
  signaled in safe code, and thus avoid having to
  add explicit checks in portable code.

Aesthetics:

  No influence.

Discussion:

  TODO
