Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the note section regarding the
  type SIMPLE-ARRAY [a] could benefit from clearer wording.

    [a]: It is implementation-dependent whether displaced arrays, vectors with
    fill pointers, or arrays that are actually adjustable are simple arrays.

  Although this is logically correct, readers might mistakenly perceive a
  contradiction with the description of SIMPLE-ARRAY [b].

    [b]: The type of an array that is not displaced to another array, has no
    fill pointer, and is not expressly adjustable is a subtype of type
    simple-array.

Proposal:

  This proposal changes the note of the type SIMPLE-ARRAY so that [a] instead
  reads:

    [a]: Recall that "subtype" means "subset" in Common Lisp. So there may be
    a conforming implementation whose type SIMPLE-ARRAY equals the type ARRAY.
    In particular, it is implementation-dependent whether displaced arrays,
    vectors with fill pointers, or arrays that are actually adjustable are
    simple arrays.

Test Cases:

  N/A

Rationale:

  This is an improvement for clarity in dpANS.

  None.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  None.

Benefits:

Aesthetics:

  No influence.

Discussion:

  None.
