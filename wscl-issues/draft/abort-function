Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the description of
  the ABORT function states that a CONTROL-ERROR will be signaled
  if an ABORT restart is not active. It does not state what the
  outcome will be if an ABORT restart is available but when invoked
  it does not dynamically transfer control or halt execution as
  expected but instead returns normally.

Proposal (ABORT-FUNCTION:SIGNAL-ERROR-ON-RETURN):

  This proposal changes the description of ABORT so that signalling
  a CONTROL-ERROR is also specified in the case of an invoked
  ABORT restart not behaving as expected. The individual proposed
  changes to the description of ABORT are:

  1. Change the "Exceptional Situations" section to the following:
     "If an appropriate abort restart is not available for the
     function abort, or an invoked abort restart does not transfer
     control and returns, or an appropriate muffle-warning restart
     is not available for the function muffle-warning, an error of
     type control-error is signaled."

Test Cases:

  (defun one ()
    (restart-bind ((abort (lambda ())))
      (abort)))
  (one) ; => [signals control-error]

Rationale:

  A caller to ABORT does not expect the function to return.
  Specifically, documentation for the ABORT restart states: "The
  intent of the ABORT restart is to allow return to the innermost
  command level." Returning to the "innermost command level" is
  normally accomplished by returning to the REPL or appropriate
  containing loop. It may imply killing the process in batch
  processing situations.

Current Practice:

  ABCL 1.8.1-dev-fasl43
    (one) => [signals control-error]

  ACL 10.1
    (one) => nil

  CCL 1.12-f98
    (one) => [signals restart-failure which is not a defined condition]

  CLASP cclasp-boehmprecise-0.4.2-4610-g5e6b2fa12-cst
    (one) => [signals control-error]

  CLISP 2.49.93+
    (one) => nil

  CMU 2019-05-27 16:42:54 (21D Unicode)
    (one) => [signals control-error]

  ECL 21.2.1-e68e6827
    (one) => [signals control-error]

  LWPE 7.1.2
    (one) => nil

  SBCL 2.1.7
    (one) => [signals control-error]
