Problem Description:

  The draft ANSI Common Lisp specification defines conditions to work very
  similarly to standard objects, but stops short of even making condition types
  actual classes. The term "condition type" is used throughout to refer to what
  DEFINE-CONDITION defines. This is sometimes inconsistent; for example the
  entry on DEFINE-CONDITION itself mentions the possibility of specializing a
  generic function on a condition type, which would only be possible if
  condition types were classes.

  This has some strange implications if taken to its arcane conclusion. For
  example, MAKE-CONDITION is defined to take a type specifier for a subtype of
  CONDITION. As written, there is no reason for, for example, an argument of
  (and foo (satisfies bar)) not to work, as it says "subtype" rather than
  "recognizable subtype". Even if this was reduced to "recognizable subtype",
  it would still be possible to for example use (and simple-condition
  program-error) to obtain an instance of a simple program error class if such
  a thing exists.

  Additionally, CLOS machinery has some features that could be useful for
  conditions. For example, the behavior of DEFINE-CONDITION for an existing
  condition type (i.e. a redefinition) is not defined, whereas DEFCLASS has rich
  machinery for dealing with redefinitions. This is not covered in this issue,
  but making condition types classes would be a prerequisite for further
  development.

  The original reason conditions weren't fully integrated into CLOS is because
  when the standard was formulated, there were doubts about CLOS, and some were
  considering CLOSless subsets of the language. These efforts seem to have
  petered out. As such there do not seem to be compelling reasons not to
  fully integrate CLOS with conditions.

Proposal (CONDITION-TYPE-CLASSES:MINIMAL):

  Amend the definition of DEFINE-CLASS to specify that it creates classes, and
  not just types. Replace uses of "condition type" throughout the standard with
  "condition class", "subclass of condition", "class", etc. as appropriate.
  Remove the restriction that conforming code cannot specialize PRINT-OBJECT on
  condition types. Redefine operators that take condition type arguments, that
  is, SIGNAL, WARN, ERROR, CERROR, MAKE-CONDITION, to instead take a condition
  class or the name of a condition class (i.e. a class that is a subclass of
  CONDITION). State that the metaclass for conditions (that is, the class of the
  class CONDITION) is not defined and, in particular, is not required to be
  STANDARD-CLASS. Strike the text stating that whether user-defined condition
  types have slots is undefined, but maintain the text leaving the slots of the
  standard condition types, if any, undefined.

  Rationale:

    Least amount of change that allows condition types to be classes.

Proposal (CONDITION-TYPE-CLASSES:MEDIUM):

  As MINIMAL. Additionally, remove the restrictions that slot access functions
  (SLOT-VALUE etc.) cannot be used on conditions. Whether (SETF SLOT-VALUE) and
  SLOT-MAKUNBOUND work could be left undefined, or they could be defined to
  signal errors.

  Rationale:

    More regularity with respect to standard objects.

Proposal (CONDITION-TYPE-CLASSES:MOST):

  As MEDIUM. Additionally, remove the restriction that MAKE-INSTANCE cannot be
  used to create conditions. Define that the initialization protocol for
  standard objects is used for conditions as well; i.e. that INITIALIZE-INSTANCE
  and SHARED-INITIALIZE are called and have the same behavior. (Because the
  condition metaclass is still not defined, there is no way to specialize
  ALLOCATE-INSTANCE or MAKE-INSTANCE, so those are not required to be called.)
  This renders MAKE-CONDITION superfluous, except that unlike MAKE-INSTANCE it
  only accepts classes that are subclasses of CONDITION.

  Rationale:

    Even more regularity.

Examples:

  ;;; Currently undefined whether this returns a class or NIL.
  ;;; Under any proposal here, returns a class.
  (find-class 'simple-error)

  ;;; Currently defined, could return a SIMPLE-ERROR.
  ;;; Under any proposal here, undefined behavior, as the provided class or
  ;;; class name isn't actually a class or class name.
  (make-condition '(and error simple-condition) ...)

  ;;; If FOO returns true on some objects of type SIMPLE-CONDITION, this is
  ;;; defined and must return such an object. Otherwise, undefined behavior.
  ;;; Obviously an implementation can't actually determine this.
  ;;; Under any proposal here, undefined behavior.
  (make-condition '(and simple-condition (satisfies foo)) ...)

  ;;; Currently undefined, since condition types might not be classes, and so
  ;;; cannot be specialized on. Even in an implementation where they are, there
  ;;; is no guarantee that this method will ever be called.
  ;;; Under MINIMAL and MEDIUM, specializing on the condition class is okay, but
  ;;; there is no guarantee that the method will be called. Under MOST, the
  ;;; method will be called any time a condition is created.
  (define-condition my-condition ...)
  (defmethod initialize-instance :after ((c my-condition) &rest initargs)
    (declare (ignore initargs))
    (print "Made a MY-CONDITION"))
  
Current Practice:

  Condition types are classes in SBCL, CCL, and Clasp. In CCL and Clasp, their
  metaclass is STANDARD-CLASS. In SBCL, it is SB-PCL::CONDITION-CLASS. In CCL
  and Clasp, INITIALIZE-INSTANCE and SHARED-INITIALIZE are called when making a
  condition, but in SBCL they don't seem to be. SLOT-VALUE works in all three,
  as does SLOT-BOUNDP. (SETF SLOT-VALUE) and SLOT-MAKUNBOUND seem to function in
  CCL and Clasp but not SBCL.

Cost to Implementors:

  All implementations checked so far already make condition types classes,
  meaning MINIMAL would take no further effort. MEDIUM also seems to be already
  implemented by these implementations. Requiring INITIALIZE-INSTANCE and
  SHARED-INITIALIZE to be called during instantiation may require some changes.

Cost to Users:

  These proposals mostly add behavior, so none, except that anyone relying on
  MAKE-CONDITION (or SIGNAL, etc.) to deal with complex types will be left in
  the lurch.

Benefits:

  Regularity. Allows specializing generic functions on condition types, which is
  sometimes done already. Allows some specialization of condition creation,
  although it should be noted that without the ability to alter slot values,
  some common uses of INITIALIZE-INSTANCE/SHARED-INITIALIZE specialization are
  impossible. It would be possible to define a method on one or both that
  inserts additional initargs to the call to the next method, though.

Cost of non-adoption:

  Existing code specializing on condition types remains nonconforming. Standard
  is irregular.

Discussion:

  Defining the condition metaclass could be worthwhile, but this could require
  additional standard symbols, and also would involve a bit more work by
  implementations in which the condition metaclass is just STANDARD-CLASS.

  Defining SHARED-INITIALIZE and INITIALIZE-INSTANCE to have behavior for
  condition classes has the slightly odd consequence that there is no specific
  method signature for that behavior, since it is left ambiguous whether
  CONDITION is a subclass of STANDARD-OBJECT.
