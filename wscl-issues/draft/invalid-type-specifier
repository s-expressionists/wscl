Problem Description:

  The draft ANSI Common Lisp specification mentions the possibility of "invalid"
  type specifiers, but does not define what functions that operate on type
  specifiers should do in such a situation.

  For example, the description of the MOD type specifier reads in part
    "The symbol MOD is not valid as a type specifier"

  A strict reading of the definition of SUBTYPEP makes it seem that the form
  (subtypep 'mod 'mod) is not permitted to return anything. Since MOD is not a
  valid type specifier, it cannot be a subtype or not be a subtype of anything,
  but NIL NIL cannot be returned because neither specifier argument involves
  any of the verboten symbols.

  (typep o 'mod) explicitly has undefined consequences. Behavior is not
  specified for (coerce o 'mod), unless "If a coercion is not possible, an error
  of type TYPE-ERROR is signaled" is taken to mean that COERCE must signal a
  type error if it runs into any problem. UPGRADED-ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE and
  UPGRADED-COMPLEX-PART-TYPE do not mention this possibility.

  MAKE-SEQUENCE, MAP, and MERGE are specified to signal a type error if their
  type specifier argument is not a recognizable subtype of LIST or VECTOR, and
  since MOD is not a type specifier, it is presumably not a recognizable subtype
  of anything.

  Other possible invalid or non type specifiers include types defined by DEFTYPE
  but used with invalid syntax, and objects that are not symbols or conses or
  classes (e.g. numbers).

Proposal (INVALID-TYPE-SPECIFIER:TYPE-ERROR):

  Amend the definitions of TYPEP, SUBTYPEP, COERCE, UPGRADED-ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE,
  UPGRADED-COMPLEX-PART-TYPE, MAKE-SEQUENCE, MAP, and MERGE to make clear that,
  if given an invalid type specifier, they signal an error of type TYPE-ERROR.

  Rationale:

    Extrapolates from the more specific signal behavior in MAKE-SEQUENCE etc.

    There does not seem to be any particular value in loosening the requirement
    so that an error must only be signaled in safe code. SUBTYPEP is generally
    not performance-critical, and implementations concerned with the performance
    of TYPEP, COERCE, and the sequence functions do compile-time processing of
    the type specifier regardless. And uses of these functions with non-constant
    type specifiers are not very common.

Proposal (INVALID-TYPE-SPECIFIER:ERROR):

  Amend the definitions of TYPEP, SUBTYPEP, COERCE, UPGRADED-ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE,
  UPGRADED-COMPLEX-PART-TYPE, MAKE-SEQUENCE, MAP, and MERGE to make clear that,
  if given an invalid type specifier, they signal an error of type TYPE-ERROR.

  Rationale:

    While this might loosen the specification of MAKE-SEQUENCE etc., the problem
    with requiring a TYPE-ERROR is that the type of type specifiers is not
    really expressible short of some complicated use of SATISFIES. This does not
    seem to be a very useful use of TYPE-ERROR.

    For example, SBCL does sometimes signal a "not a type specifier" type error.
    The type it uses is (or cons symbol sb-kernel:classoid class), which
    obviously includes many invalid type specifiers, such as MOD.

Examples:

  (subtypep 5 5)
  (typep 5 'mod)
  (deftype foo (bar) (declare (ignore bar)) 't) (typep 5 'foo)

Current Practice:

  Test 1 is (subtypep 5 5)
  Test 2 is (subtypep 5 6)
  Test 3 is (typep 5 'mod)
  Test 4 is (deftype foo (bar) (declare (ignore bar)) 't) (typep 5 'foo)

         Test 1         Test 2          Test 3        Test 4
  SBCL   T T            type-error      error         error
  CCL    program-error  program-error   program-error program-error
  Clasp  T T            error           program-error program-error

  CCL conforms to ERROR. SBCL and Clasp conform to error except that their
  implementations of SUBTYPEP return true immediately if the arguments are EQUAL
  even if they are not valid type specifiers. (Notably, SBCL has different
  behavior if the test form is compiled - it signals a TYPE-ERROR.)

  Other implementation behaviors that could be checked include giving a
  non-type-error on (make-sequence 'mod) from macroexpanding the type,
  returning REAL from UPGRADED-COMPLEX-PART-TYPE without doing any checking,
  and others, but this may not be worth recording.

Cost to Implementors:

  Either proposal would require some implementations to perform more checking.
  TYPE-ERROR would require implementations to figure out how to write a type
  for type specifiers, and to be sure to handle macroexpansion errors within
  their implementations of the type system.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Benefits:

  Either proposal gives more coherent behavior. Either proposal legitimizes the
  rare but existent idiom of using (values (ignore-errors (subtypep foo t)))
  to determine if FOO is a valid type specifier, though this could perhaps be
  handled better by an extension of the type system.

Discussion:
