Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the description of the system
  class SEQUENCE [a] conflicts with the description of the Sequence Concepts
  [b], where

    [a]: The types vector and the type list are disjoint subtypes of type
    sequence, but are not necessarily an exhaustive partition of sequence.

    [b]: A sequence is an ordered collection of elements, implemented as
    either a vector or a list.

Proposal:

  This proposal changes the description of the Sequence Concepts so that [b]
  instead reads:

    > A sequence is an ordered collection of elements, implemented either as a
    vector, a list, or possibly something else.

Test Cases:

  N/A (Test cases are difficult to provide, because conformating
  implementations are not expected to expose its definition of a SEQUENCE
  programmatically.)

Rationale:

  This is a plain contradiction in dpANS.

Current Practice:

  SBCL 2.4.1
    (slot-value (sb-kernel::specifier-type 'sequence) 'sb-kernel::types)
      ;; => (#<SB-KERNEL:CONS-TYPE CONS>
             #<SB-KERNEL:MEMBER-TYPE NULL>
             #<SB-KERNEL:ARRAY-TYPE VECTOR>
             #<SB-KERNEL:NAMED-TYPE SB-KERNEL:EXTENDED-SEQUENCE>)

Cost to Implementors:

  None.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  None.

Benefits:

  Remove a conflict from the standard.

Aesthetics:

  No influence.

Discussion:

  None.
