Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the description of
  STRING=, STRING-EQUAL, STRING-NOT-EQUAL and related functions
  mentions STRING-NOT-EQUAL in the list of names, and in the Syntax
  section, but not in the Description section.

Proposal (STRING-NOT-EQUAL-MISSING-DESCRIPTION:ADD-DESCRIPTION):

  In the Description section, change the passage

    string-equal
      string-equal is just like string= except that differences in
      case are ignored; two characters are considered to be the same
      if char-equal is true of them.

  to

    string-equal, string-not-equal
      string-equal and string-not-equal are just like string= and
      string/=, respectively, except that differences in case are
      ignored; two characters are considered to be the same if
      char-equal is true of them.

Test Cases:

  None.

Rationale:

  We think it was a simple omission from the draft ANSI specification
  to not mention STRING-NOT-EQUAL in the Description section.

Current Practice:

  None.

Cost to Implementors:

  None.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  No explicit description of the behavior of STRING-NOT-EQUAL in the
  specification.

Benefits:

  Closes a hole in the specified behavior.

Aesthetics:

  Makes the Description section more regular.

Discussion:

  None.
