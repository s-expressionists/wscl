Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the section Exceptional
  Situations of the description of the operator MAKE-PACKAGE indicates
  that a correctable error is signaled if the name or any of the
  nicknames supplied is already the name of an existing package, but
  it does not mention any particular subtype of ERROR.  It seems
  appropriate to signal an error of type PACKAGE-ERROR.

Proposal (MAKE-PACKAGE-SIGNALS-PACKAGE-ERROR-IF-EXISTS):

  This proposal changes the phrase "A correctable error is signaled if
  the PACKAGE-NAME or any of the nicknames is already the name or
  nickname of an existing package" to "A correctable error of type
  PACKAGE-ERROR is signaled if the PACKAGE-NAME or any of the
  nicknames is already the name or nickname of an existing package".

Test cases:

  (defun one (name)
    (typep (nth-value 1 (ignore-errors
                          (progn (make-package name)
                                 (make-package name))))
           'package-error))

  (one "hello") ; => T

Rationale:

  It seems natural that an operator that has to do with packages would
  signal an error of type PACKAGE-ERROR.

Current Practice:

  SBCL 2.1.3
  (one "hello") => T

  CCL 1.12.1
  (one "hello") => NIL

  ECL 23.9.9
  (one "hello") => [presumably a class precedence list]

  Clasp 2.5.0
  (one "hello") => T

  CLISP 2.49.92
  (one "hello" => T

  GCL 2.6.14
  (one "hello") => T

  ABCL 1.9.2
  (one "hello") => NIL

Cost to Implementors:

  Very small.  We believe that most implementations already signal an
  error of type PACKAGE-ERROR.  Some implementations may signal an
  error of a different type, but it would be a fairly simple change to
  make them signal a PACKAGE-ERROR instead.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  Users who want to handle errors as a result of invoking MAKE-PACKAGE
  have to handle all errors to detect this exceptional situation, and
  the error can then be the result of some other exceptional
  situation, thereby complicating error handling.

Benefits:

  Application programmers may rely on an error of type PACKAGE-ERROR
  being signaled for this exceptional situation.

Aesthetics:

  No influence.

Discussion:

  TODO.
