Status:         draft

Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the description of the
  operators INCF and DECF does not explicitly mention what value is
  returned from the form.  The only hint is the name of the return
  value, i.e., NEW-VALUE.

Proposal (INCF-DECF-VALUE-NOT-SPECIFIED:SPECIFY-VALUE-AFTER-UPDATE):

  This proposal changes the description of the operators INCF and DECF
  so that the following phrase is added to the section "Description",
  after the second sentence in that section:

  "This result is then returned."

Test Cases:

  (- *read-base* (incf *read-base*)) ; => -1
  (- *read-base* (decf *read-base*)) ; => 1

Rationale:

  We think it was a simple omission from the draft ANSI specification
  to leave the return value unspecified.

Current Practice:

Cost to Implementors:

  None.  We are convinced that all implementations return the correct
  value.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  New implementations could fail to return the new value.

Benefits:

  Application programmers can rely on the value being returned.

Aesthetics:

  No influence.

Discussion:

  TODO
