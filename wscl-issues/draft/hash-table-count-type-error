Problem Description:

  In the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification, the description of the
  function HASH-TABLE-COUNT indicates no exceptional situations.  The
  section "Arguments and Values" mentions that the hash-table argument
  must be a hash table, which by default means that the consequences
  are undefined if an object that is not of type HASH-TABLE is given.

Proposal (HASH-TABLE-COUNT-TYPE-ERROR:SIGNAL-ERROR-IN-SAFE-CODE):

  This proposal changes the description of the HASH-TABLE-COUNT
  function, so that the section "Exceptional Situations" instead
  reads:

  "The function HASH-TABLE-COUNT should signal an error of type
  TYPE-ERROR if the hash-table argument is not a hash table."

Test Cases:

  (defun one (object)
    (declare (optimize (safety 3)))
    (hash-table-count object))

  (one 234) ; => [signals TYPE-ERROR with expected type HASH-TABLE]

Rationale:

  We think it was a simple omission from the draft ANSI specification
  to indicate no exceptional situations.  The fact that the function
  HASH-TABLE-SIZE mentions such an error situation seems to support
  this idea.

Current Practice:

Cost to Implementors:

  Very small.  We believe that most implementations are already
  signaling an error in safe code.  Some implementations may signal a
  simple error, and those implementation would need to signal a
  TYPE-ERROR instead.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  Application programmers may need to add explicit checks to be
  certain that their code is conforming.

Benefits:

  Application programmers may rely on an error being
  signaled in safe code, and thus avoid having to
  add explicit checks in portable code.

Aesthetics:

  No influence.
