Problem description:

The 'readtable' argument to GET-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHARACTER and to
GET-MACRO-CHARACTER must be of type READTABLE, without mention of
what happens when NIL is supplied. This may have been simply
an oversight, since it makes more sense for it to refer to values from
the standard readtable.  Both COPY-READTABLE and SET-SYNTAX-FROM-CHAR
explicitly say that a NIL in the 'from-readtable' argument refers to the
standard readtable.  Also, an example in the middle of the page, CLtL
p.378, supplies a NIL to GET-MACRO-CHARACTER, and is clearly intending
to access the standard readtable values.


Proposal (GET-MACRO-CHARACTER-READTABLE:NIL-STANDARD)

Specify that a NIL readtable argument to GET-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHARACTER
and to GET-MACRO-CHARACTER mean the same thing it does for COPY-READTABLE,
and SET-SYNTAX-FROM-CHAR; namely a reference to the standard readtable.  
Thus (GET-MACRO-CHARACTER <char> NIL) would be equivalent to 
(GET-MACRO-CHARACTER <char> (COPY-READTABLE)), but without consing.

Rationale:

Probably was the original intent; somebody wants it; also see "Esthetics".

Current practice:

Symbolics and Xerox have already implemented the proposal; Lucid, VAXLISP,
and KCL stuck to the more rigid interpretation.


Cost to Implementors:

Trivial.

Cost to Users:

None.

Cost of non-adoption:

Minor worry about porting between implementations that support the
generalization and those that don't; minor worry about consing when
calling (COPY-READTABLE) to get at standard readtable semantics.

Performance impact:

See "Cost of non-adoption".

Benefits:

See "Cost of non-adoption".

Esthetics:

Increases parallel design among similar readtable functions.

Discussion:

This question was raised in the Common Lisp mailing last summer:
    Date: 19 Jul 88 13:35
    Subject: Question about readtable null arguments
    From: quiroz%cs.rochester:EDU:Xerox
    To: common-lisp%sail.stanford:EDU:Xerox

This issue passed at the Jan 89 X3J13 meeting. The only
difference between version 2 and 3 was to remove the
test case because of problems of "function equivalence":

If "same-function-p" compared functions:

(let ((standard-rt (copy-readtable))
      (chars '(#\* #\= #\| #\A #\  #\( #\# #\1)))
  ;; Test Case 1
  (dolist (char chars)
    (assert (same-function-p (get-macro-character char nil)
                (get-macro-character char standard-rt))
            () "Lose on character ~C" char))
  ;; Test Case 2
  (dolist (char chars)
    (assert (same-function-p (get-dispatch-macro-character #\# char nil)
                (get-dispatch-macro-character #\# char standard-rt))
            () "Lose on #\# dispatch character ~C" char))
  ;; Test Case 3
  (assert (same-function-p (get-dispatch-macro-character #\# #\A nil)
              (get-dispatch-macro-character #\# #\a nil))
          () "Lose on #\# dispatch character ~C" char)
 )
