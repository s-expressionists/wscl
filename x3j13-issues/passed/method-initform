Problem description:

  Should CALL-NEXT-METHOD and NEXT-METHOD-P be allowed in initforms for
  optional and keyword parameters and &AUX variables of methods?  The
  document currently allows them only in the body of a method, not in forms
  embedded in the lambda-list, although it takes a close reading of the
  document to discern this.

  There are two proposals in this issue.

  This is Symbolics issue #15.

Proposal (METHOD-INITFORM:ALLOW-CALL-NEXT-METHOD):

  Expand the lexical scope of CALL-NEXT-METHOD and NEXT-METHOD-P to include
  all forms in a method, including forms embedded in the lambda-list.

Rationale:

  This seems more natural and consistent.

Proposal (METHOD-INITFORM:FORBID-CALL-NEXT-METHOD):
          
  The lexical scope of CALL-NEXT-METHOD and NEXT-METHOD-P includes only
  forms in the body of a method.

Rationale:

  This is the status quo and is easier to implement.

Examples:

  (defmethod foo ((x myclass) &aux (y (call-next-method)))
    (if (null y)
        (zzz)
        (list ':baz y)))
  ;is briefer than
  (defmethod foo ((x myclass))
    (let ((y (call-next-method)))
      (if (null y)
          (zzz)
          (list ':baz y))))

  (defmethod countem ((x myclass) &optional (local (not (next-method-p))))
    (let ((accum (if local 0 (call-next-method))))
      (dolist (y (frobs x))
        (incf accum y))
      accum))
  ;is briefer than
  (defmethod countem ((x myclass) &optional (local nil local-p))
    (let ((accum (if (if local-p local (not (next-method-p)))
                     0 (call-next-method))))
      (dolist (y (frobs x))
        (incf accum y))
      accum))

  (defmethod jack-of-confusion ((x myclass))
     (defmethod ace-of-confusion ((x myclass)
                                  &optional (y (call-next-method)))
       (borf x y))
     (ace-of-confusion x))
  ;In METHOD-INITFORM:ALLOW-CALL-NEXT-METHOD, the default value for y
  ;is the value returned by an ace-of-confusion method.
  ;In METHOD-INITFORM:FORBID-CALL-NEXT-METHOD, the default value for y
  ;is the value returned by a jack-of-confusion method.

Current practice:

  Symbolics Genera 8.0, Lucid 4.0.0 Beta-1, and recent versions of
  PCL appear to implement METHOD-INITFORM:ALLOW-CALL-NEXT-METHOD.
  TI Explorer release 6 does not.
  Apple and IIM implement METHOD-INITFORM:FORBID-CALL-NEXT-METHOD.

  The first example does not actually work in Genera due to a bug.

  Other CLOS implementations were not surveyed.

Cost to Implementors:

  In METHOD-INITFORM:ALLOW-CALL-NEXT-METHOD, handling CALL-NEXT-METHOD and
  NEXT-METHOD-P by simply wrapping a FLET or MACROLET around the body will
  not work.  If they are called from forms in the lambda-list some
  massaging of the lambda-list is necessary.  It's not very difficult,
  though.

  METHOD-INITFORM:FORBID-CALL-NEXT-METHOD has no cost to implementors.

Cost to Users:

  None for either proposal.

Cost of non-adoption:

  METHOD-INITFORM:FORBID-CALL-NEXT-METHOD forbids a programming technique
  that users might find useful.  METHOD-INITFORM:ALLOW-CALL-NEXT-METHOD
  requires a little more work for implementors, who might have thought
  they had finished their CLOS implementations by now.

Performance impact:

  None.

Benefits:

  METHOD-INITFORM:FORBID-CALL-NEXT-METHOD avoids changing the status quo.
  METHOD-INITFORM:ALLOW-CALL-NEXT-METHOD provides a programming technique
  that users might find useful.

Esthetics:

  METHOD-INITFORM:ALLOW-CALL-NEXT-METHOD seems more uniform.

Discussion:

  Jeff Dalton suggests that the places where CALL-NEXT-METHOD is allowed
  should be consistent with the places where RETURN from an implicit block
  is allowed.  This probably supports FORBID-CALL-NEXT-METHOD.

  Gregor Kiczales says he supports FORBID-CALL-NEXT-METHOD, but is not
  adamant about it.  He thinks FORBID-CALL-NEXT-METHOD is more natural.
