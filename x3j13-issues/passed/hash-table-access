Problem Description:
 
  There are many characteristics of hash-tables which are specified upon
  creation but are not accessible afterwards.
 
Proposal: (HASH-TABLE-ACCESS:X3J13-MAR-89)
 
  Add the following functions to the language:
 
  HASH-TABLE-REHASH-SIZE hash-table
 
    Returns the current rehash size of a hash table.
 
  HASH-TABLE-REHASH-THRESHOLD hash-table
 
    Returns the current rehash threshold of a hash table.
 
  HASH-TABLE-SIZE hash-table
 
    Returns the current size of a hash table.
 
  HASH-TABLE-TEST hash-table
 
    Returns the test used for comparing keys in the hash table.
    By default the value will be EQL.
 
  Define that the results of HASH-TABLE-REHASH-SIZE, 
  HASH-TABLE-REHASH-THRESHOLD, and HASH-TABLE-SIZE are suitable
  for use in a call to MAKE-HASH-TABLE in order to produce a hash
  table with state corresponding to the current state of the hash
  table.

  Clarify that the result of HASH-TABLE-TEST is always a symbol
  naming a function rather than the function itself if the test
  is one of those defined by this standard. (Implementations which
  provide additional tests for hash tables may determine how this
  function relates to such extended tests.)
 
Current Practice:
 
  VAX LISP and Lucid 3.0 implement the proposal.
 
Cost to Implementors:
 
  Most of these should be trivial to implement, since the information
  must be present for nearly all types.
 
Cost to Users:
 
  None.  This is an upward-compatible extension.
 
Cost of Non-Adoption:
 
  The benefits would not be available in a portable fashion.
 
Benefits:
 
  Programs would be able to access useful information otherwise hidden.
  For example, it would allow programs to gain statistics about hash
  table usage that might enable better tuning.
 
Discussion:
 
  None of these are required to be SETF'able, though some might be
  reasonable implementation-dependent extensions.  Including such
  modification abilities might constrain some implementations unduly.
