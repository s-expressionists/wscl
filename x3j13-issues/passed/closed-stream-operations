Status: Passed Jan 89 X3J13 with amendment to specify that CLOSE on a
closed stream returns NIL. At Mar 89 X3J13, amendment was withdrawn;
this version stands.

Problem Description:
 
 The description of CLOSE is not completely clear about the functions
 which are allowed to be performed on a closed stream.
 
 On p332 it says:

  ``The stream is closed. No further Input/output operations may be
    performed on it. However, certain inquiry operations may still
    be performed, ...''

  but the list of inquiry operations is not specified.
 
Proposal (CLOSED-STREAM-FUNCTIONS:ALLOW-INQUIRY)
 
 Clarify the behavior of the following functions on closed streams:

  * STREAMP is unaffected by whether its stream argument is open or closed.
 
  * If CLOSE is called on a stream which is open, it will return T.
    However, if CLOSE is called on a stream which is closed, it
    will succeed without error but the return value is not specified.
 
  * PATHNAME is valid on either an open or closed stream. Since some
    implementations cannot provide the truename of a file until the
    file is closed, it would in principle be possible for PATHNAME in
    some implementations to return more specific information after the
    stream is closed. For consistency, however, PATHNAME is prohibited
    from doing this. PATHNAME must return the same pathname after a
    file is closed as it did before. (The passed proposal in issue
    PATHNAME-STREAM still stands.)
 
  * TRUENAME is valid on either an open or closed stream. Since some
    implementations cannot provide the truename of a file until the
    file is closed, it is permissible TRUENAME to return more specific
    information after the stream is closed.
 
  * MERGE-PATHNAMES, PATHNAME-HOST, PATHNAME-DEVICE, PATHNAME-DIRECTORY,
    PATHNAME-NAME, PATHNAME-TYPE, PATHNAME-VERSION, NAMESTRING, 
    FILE-NAMESTRING, DIRECTORY-NAMESTRING, HOST-NAMESTRING, 
    ENOUGH-NAMESTRING, and OPEN are valid on either open or closed streams.
    For any of these operations, using a stream, S, as an argument 
    where appropriate is equivalent to using (PATHNAME s). See the
    description of PATHNAME above to understand the consequences of this.
 
  * PROBE-FILE and DIRECTORY are valid on either open or closed streams.
    For either of these operations, using a stream, S, as an argument 
    where appropriate is equivalent to using (PATHNAME s). See the
    description of PATHNAME above to understand the consequences of this.
    In this case of these operators however, closed stream may well be the
    most reliable arguments in some cases, since treatment of open streams
    to the file system may vary considerably between implementations.
    For example, in some operating systems, open files are written under
    temporary names and not renamed until close and/or are held invisible
    until a close is performed. In general, any code with an intent to be
    highly portable should tread lightly when using PROBE-FILE or
    DIRECTORY.
 
Rationale:
 
 One can consider many characteristics of a stream to be independent of
 the ability to do I/O.  Being able to determine a stream's direction and
 its name is often useful for debugging.  A number of the descriptions in
 CLtL imply (weakly) the ability to work on closed streams.  Functions
 such as OPEN and DIRECTORY don't really depend on the stream, but on
 the name of the stream.
 
Current Practice:
 
 At least two implementations differ in which functions are allowed to be
 performed on a closed stream.
 
Cost to Implementors:
 
 Unknown, but likely to be small in most implementations.

 A nontrivial amount of work may be necessary if the pathname information
 is held  externally and is normally deleted when the stream is closed. 
 The implementation will have to copy the information at some time for later
 inquiries.

Cost to Users:

 Likely to be small; users of an implementation forced to change
 by this proposal might have to make some modifications to make their
 programs portable.
 
Benefits:
 
 These clarifications will assist users in writing portable code.
 
Aesthetics:
 
 Most people will probably see these clarifications as an improvement
 in aesthetics.
 
Discussion:

 There are some separate, but related, issues regarding what CLOSE
 should do on composite streams or constructed streams such as
 created by MAKE-BROADCAST-STREAM. These issues will be addressed
 in a separate issue (CLOSE-CONSTRUCTED-STREAMS).

 There was some discussion on whether INPUT-STREAM-P and OUTPUT-STREAM-P
 should return "false" on a stream that had been closed. The issue
 STREAM-ACCESS contains a proposal to add a function OPEN-STREAM-P
 which might be useful for the same purpose. This issue was separated
 out into a separate issue (INPUT-STREAM-P-CLOSED).

 The other functions in proposal STREAM-ACCESS:PROVIDE should
 work on closed streams.

 The functions in STREAM-INFO:ONE-DIMENSIONAL-FUNCTIONS should
 not be requred to work on closed streams.
