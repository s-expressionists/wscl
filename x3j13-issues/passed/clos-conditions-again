Problem description:

  The condition system should not be too tightly integrated into CLOS, for
  two reasons:  Some implementations already have a native condition system
  that is not based on CLOS, and it should be possible to integrate the
  native conditions and the ANSI CL conditions.  Some people would like to
  define an ANSI Common Lisp subset that does not contain CLOS but does
  contain conditions.

  The problem areas are the use of DEFCLASS, MAKE-INSTANCE, and DEFMETHOD
  to define and create conditions, rather than using more abstract macros
  that conceal the implementation of conditions in terms of CLOS, and
  exposure of the implementation of condition slots as CLOS slots.  If user
  code was written in a more abstract way, it could run in a subset language
  that did not contain CLOS.

  This is Symbolics issue #7.

Proposal (CLOS-CONDITIONS-AGAIN:ALLOW-SUBSET):
	  
  1. Specify that conforming code must use DEFINE-CONDITION (not DEFCLASS)
  to define conditions, and MAKE-CONDITION (not MAKE-INSTANCE) to make
  conditions.  (These two operators already exist in ANSI Common Lisp.)

  2. Specify that conforming code must use the :REPORT option of
  DEFINE-CONDITION (not DEFMETHOD for PRINT-OBJECT) to define a condition
  reporter.

  3. Specify that conforming code must not use SLOT-VALUE, SLOT-BOUNDP,
  SLOT-MAKUNBOUND, or WITH-SLOTS on condition objects.  Instead it must
  call the accessor functions defined by DEFINE-CONDITION.

  4. Clarify that this proposal does not rule out the use of multiple
  parent-types in DEFINE-CONDITION.

Rationale:

  1. The reasons are two:
     - permit flexibility in making the native class system compatible
       with the ANSI CL one
     - permit dialects that don't want CLOS to be available to run most
       common condition-related code.

  2. The reasons are three:
     - isolate the report part without forcing the user to deal with the
       case of *PRINT-ESCAPE* being true.
     - keep a CL subset from having to implement DEFMETHOD to get this
       important functionality.
     - don't define two ways to do the same thing.

  3. Using the existing accessor functions seems more conservative than
     requiring non-CLOS subsets to implement an ersatz SLOT-VALUE function.

     Note also that the requirement here (in #3) is on conforming -code-.
     An -implementation- can permit the use of SLOT-VALUE, SLOT-BOUNDP,
     SLOT-MAKUNBOUND, and/or WITH-SLOTS as an extension and still be 
     conforming.  Programs which used such an extension would not be
     conforming and might not be portable to all implementations.

  4. There is no substitute for multiple inheritance, and given the
     limited set of operations that can be performed on conditions, it
     is easy to fake it.

Current practice:

  1. DEFINE-CONDITION and MAKE-CONDITION are already in the language.

  2. The :REPORT option to DEFINE-CONDITION exists.

  3. Some implementations support use of WITH-SLOTS and some do not.
     Programs that use WITH-SLOTS are not yet portable.

  4. DEFINE-CONDITION is already specified to support multiple inheritance.

Cost to Implementors:

  Trivial.

Cost to Users:

  They have to write their programs in terms of the condition abstractions
  if they want them to be portable.

Cost of non-adoption:

  Condition-using programs will not be portable to Common Lisp subsets that
  don't have CLOS.

Performance impact:

  None.

Benefits:

  See rationale.

Esthetics:

  Abstraction is more esthetic than revealing the implementation.

Discussion:

  Pitman and Moon support this proposal.
